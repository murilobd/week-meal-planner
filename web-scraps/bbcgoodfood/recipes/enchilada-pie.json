  "description": "Give your midweek meal a Mexican twist with our easy enchilada pie. Packed with nutritious veggies, it provides a whopping four of your 5-a-day",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 tbsp vegetable oil or rapeseed oil",
    "2 peppers, any colour you like, sliced",
    "1 red onion, halved and sliced",
    "400g can mixed beans, drained",
    "2tsp-2 tbsp fajita spice mix (depending on how spicy you like it)",
    "400g can chopped tomatoes",
    "small bunch coriander, chopped",
    "4 corn tortillas",
    "100g low-fat soured cream",
    "30g grated cheddar"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Heat the oil in a pan. Fry the peppers and onion until soft, about 10 mins. Add the beans, fajita spice mix, chopped tomatoes and some seasoning. Bubble for 5 mins to reduce the tomatoes a little, then stir in most of the coriander. Heat the grill and warm the tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds.",
    "Spread a quarter of the pepper and onion mixture over the base of an ovenproof dish (a round one, if possible) or frying pan. Top with some of the soured cream and a warm tortilla, then repeat the layers three more times, finishing off with a final layer of soured cream. Sprinkle over the cheese and grill for 5 mins, or until golden and bubbling. Scatter with the remaining coriander before serving."
