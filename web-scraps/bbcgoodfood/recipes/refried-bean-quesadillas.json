  "description": "This casual meat-free main is a cheap and cheerful way to fill up your friends",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 tbsp sunflower oil",
    "1 onion, finely chopped",
    "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "1 tsp cumin seeds",
    "400g can pinto or kidney beans, rinsed and drained",
    "2 tsp smoked paprika",
    "8 flour tortillas",
    "100g cheddar or gruyère, coarsely grated",
    "handful coriander leaves",
    "200g tub fresh tomato salsa, plus extra to serve",
    "soured cream, to serve"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the onion and garlic for 2 mins. Add the cumin and cook for 1 min more. Tip in the beans, paprika and a splash of water. Using a potato masher, break the beans down as they warm through to make a rough purée. Season generously.",
    "Spread the refried beans onto 4 of the tortillas and scatter over the cheese and coriander. Spoon over the salsa, then top with the remaining tortillas to make 4 sandwiches. Wipe the frying pan with kitchen paper and return to the heat or heat a griddle pan. Cook each sandwich for 1-2 mins on each side until the tortillas are crisp and golden and the cheese is melting. Serve warm, cut into wedges, with extra salsa and soured cream for dipping."
