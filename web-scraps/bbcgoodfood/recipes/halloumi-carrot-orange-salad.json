  "description": "Serve this halloumi, carrot, orange and watercress salad with a mustard and honey dressing for an easy lunch or starter. It takes just 20 minutes to make and delivers one of your 5-a-day",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 large oranges",
    "1½ tbsp wholegrain mustard",
    "1½ tsp honey",
    "1 tbsp white wine vinegar",
    "3 tbsp rapeseed or olive oil, plus extra for frying",
    "2 large carrots, peeled",
    "225g block halloumi, sliced",
    "100g bag watercress or baby spinach"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Cut the peel and pith away from the oranges. Use a small serrated knife to segment the orange, catching any juices in a bowl, then squeeze any excess juice from the off-cut pith into the bowl as well. Add the mustard, honey, vinegar, oil and some seasoning to the bowl and mix well.",
    "Using a vegetable peeler, peel carrot ribbons into the dressing bowl and toss gently. Heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan and cook the halloumi for a few mins until golden on both sides. Toss the watercress through the dressed carrots. Arrange the watercress mixture on plates and top with the halloumi and oranges."
