  "description": "This quick, fibre-rich veggie supper is filling and good for you too. Chickpeas are a great source of manganese, which is essential for healthy bone structure",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 tbsp rapeseed oil",
    "2 garlic cloves, chopped",
    "1 yellow pepper, deseeded and diced",
    "½ - 1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped",
    "½ bunch spring onions (about 5), tops and whites sliced but kept separate",
    "1 tsp cumin, plus a little extra to serve (optional)",
    "1 tsp coriander",
    "½ tsp turmeric",
    "3 tomatoes, cut into wedges",
    "⅓ pack coriander, chopped",
    "400g can chickpeas in water, drained but liquid reserved",
    "½ tsp reduced-salt bouillon powder (we used Marigold)",
    "4 large  eggs"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Heat the oil in a non-stick sauté pan, add the garlic, pepper, chilli and the whites from the spring onions, and fry for 5 mins over a medium-high heat. Meanwhile, put a large pan of water on to boil.",
    "Add the spices, tomatoes, most of the coriander and the chickpeas to the sauté pan and cook for 1-2 mins more. Stir in the bouillon powder and enough liquid from the chickpeas to moisten everything, and leave to simmer gently.",
    "Once the water is at a rolling boil, crack in your eggs and poach for 2 mins, then remove with a slotted spoon. Stir the spring onion tops into the chickpeas, then very lightly crush a few of the chickpeas with a fork or potato masher. Spoon the chickpea mixture onto plates, scatter with the reserved coriander and top with the eggs. Serve with an extra sprinkle of cumin, if you like."
