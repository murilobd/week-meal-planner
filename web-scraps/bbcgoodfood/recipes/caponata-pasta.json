  "description": "Whip up our easy vegetarian caponata pasta in just 20 minutes. It's simple to make and packs three of your five-a-day into one delicious meal",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 tbsp olive oil (or use the oil from your chargrilled veg, see below)",
    "1 large onion, finely chopped",
    "4 garlic cloves, finely sliced",
    "250g chargrilled Mediterranean veg (peppers and aubergines, if possible) from a jar, pot or deli counter, drained if in oil (you can use this oil in place of the olive oil) and roughly chopped",
    "400g can chopped tomatoes",
    "1 tbsp small capers",
    "2 tbsp raisins",
    "350g rigatoni, penne or another short pasta shape",
    "bunch basil leaves, picked",
    "parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), shaved, to serve"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 8-10 mins until starting to caramelise (or for longer if you have time – the sweeter the better). Add the garlic for the final 2 mins of cooking time.",
    "Tip in the mixed veg, tomatoes, capers and raisins. Season well and simmer, uncovered, for 10 mins, or until you have a rich sauce.",
    "Meanwhile, boil the kettle. Pour the kettleful of water into a large pan with a little salt and bring back to the boil. Add the pasta and cook until tender with a little bite, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Tip the pasta into the sauce, adding a splash of pasta water if it needs loosening. Scatter with the basil leaves and parmesan, if you like, and serve straight from the pan"
