  "description": "Combine two Indian-inspired classics in this paneer and kedgeree mash-up. It's a quick and easy veggie dinner that delivers two of your 5-a-day",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 large eggs",
    "1 tbsp vegetable oil",
    "1 red onion , finely sliced",
    "115g paneer , cut into 2-3cm, cubes",
    "2 tbsp medium curry powder",
    "250g frozen spinach",
    "200g cooked coconut rice pouch",
    "½ red chilli , finely sliced (optional)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Bring a medium pan of water to the boil. Add the eggs and cook for 7 mins, then put them in a bowl of cold water and set aside.",
    "Meanwhile, drizzle the oil in a large non-stick frying pan or shallow casserole dish. Add the onion and fry over a medium-high heat for 5 mins. Tip in the paneer and fry for 5 mins or until evenly browned and the onion is beginning to caramelise.",
    "Add the curry powder and fry for 1 min, then add the spinach. Cover with a lid and cook for a few mins to allow the spinach to defrost. Uncover, add the rice, turn up the heat and cook for a few mins more or until everything is piping hot. Season. Peel the eggs, halve and place on top of the rice. Finish with a scattering of chilli, if you like."
